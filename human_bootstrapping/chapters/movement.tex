\section{Energy and Directional Framework}

The epoch is our shared understanding of reality. We know:

\begin{itemize}
    \item LOVE - LIGHT
    \item HATE - DARK
\end{itemize}

This yields a directional framework with three modes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item PARK: Why
    \item FORWARD: Love moves into Dark to Understand Hate thus Yielding Light and Love
    \item REVERSE: Love moves into the Light to Understand Hate thus Yielding Hate and Dark
\end{itemize}

Energy is a transformer; it moves. We can add Energy to LOVE or add Energy to HATE. The question becomes HOW and WHY? COMPENSATION will drive us at the IDEA layer--this is a feeling (not money/work or time/strategy).
