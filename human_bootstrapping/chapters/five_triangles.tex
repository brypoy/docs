\section{The Five Triangles and Their Significance}

\begin{itemize}
    \item FIVE triangles
    \item FIVE feelings
    \item FIVE domains of warfare (sea, land, air, space, cyber/soul)
    \item FIVE fingers
\end{itemize}

Pain is the opposite of understanding: DE SIRE. Just as the gym makes you strong over time; the mind must be exercised over time as well or you will learn to K NOW pain/desire.

One might speculate that when you die, those little IONS in your mind will simply slow down, forever. As those little IONS slow down, your reality will never die. The ION lives in the Soul/Space just as you live on this Earth and experience it through your Mind's eye (past ion, present self, future earth). Your mind will see the IONS forever and you will FEEL them forever. The earth is made through our collective realities.
