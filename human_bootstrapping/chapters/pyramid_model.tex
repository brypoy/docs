In the pyramid model, the five triangles at the bottom (UN) represent the foundation, the three middle triangles (KNOWN) represent community, service, and justice, and the single top triangle represents the MIND. Your Mind is the strongest at the top and it knows the three triangles in the middle. You must trust the middle triangles to truly understand the UN. When the mind's eye understands the five unknown triangles, this is called EPIPHANY or feeling.
