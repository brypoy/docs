\section{Demand for Relief}

We demand the following actions to rectify these constitutional violations:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Policy Reinterpretation:} The USPS, in conjunction with DoD and DHS, must issue a new regulation stating that mail between U.S. persons originating from and delivered to APO/FPO/DPO addresses is \textbf{domestic mail}.
\item \textbf{Exemption:} Such mail shall be \textbf{exempt from USPS customs declaration forms} (PS Form 2976) unless specific, articulable facts give rise to a reasonable suspicion of illegal content.
\item \textbf{Diplomatic Action:} The State Department must \textbf{renegotiate relevant SOFA provisions} to reflect that the U.S. exercises full sovereignty over the movement of personal effects from its military installations to the continental United States.
\item \textbf{Remedy:} Cease the current practice of detaining, opening, or seizing domestic APO/FPO/DPO mail due to the lack of a customs form.
\item \textbf{Congressional Oversight:} The relevant congressional committees should hold hearings on this systematic violation of service members' constitutional rights and consider legislative solutions if executive agencies fail to act.
\end{itemize}

The constitutional violations documented in this memorandum require immediate corrective action. The current system undermines the rights of those who sacrifice to protect our nation and represents a fundamental breach of the government's duty to its citizens.
