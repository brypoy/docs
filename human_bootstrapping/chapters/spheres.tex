\section{The Three Spheres}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ION
    \item MIND
    \item PLANET (PLAN IT) - Perhaps Earth Was Planned
\end{itemize}

Understanding the interactions within these three spheres, combined with our triangle model (similar to the one on the dollar bill), helps guide our thoughts. The pyramid represents teamwork, and the currency is MOVEMENT (what gives money power).

Movement can be upward or downward together. DEAMONs MOAN from below--the UN. We know pain first, so we move away from it. The UN KNOWN (we wonder or W UN DER). Our understanding may cause us to move toward it again.
