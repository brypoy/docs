\section{Mental Models and Geometric Foundations}

The triangle and sphere represent the strongest forms according to reality. There are eight triangles in a sphere, and when we stack four triangles, we observe a triforce pattern. This configuration reveals that the middle triangle is empty (representing FORCE), while five triangles below form the foundation of a WHOLE (HOLY) Sphere comprising:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ION - self in space (force)
    \item KNOWN - 3x triangles (community, service, justice -- as defined by our constitution; represented in Zelda games)
    \item UN - 5x triangles; understanding these is essential for success
\end{itemize}
