\section{Conclusion: Towards a Unified Model}

We now have the makings for any religion or reality, for we have a model for the soul; rapidly moving from the qualitative to the quantitative and back again; this is thought. Qualities reside in the five triangles and are interpreted through our ability to quantify the qualities through the three triangles of measurement.

When you have lived a "good" life then the feeling will be so when you die and it is what "you" become. Our ions can go backwards in "time". We experience these things as reality. The combined feeling that we all agree on is the same... love, hate and degrees to each. The degree must be a measure of understanding versus desire. Your Degree may or may not be the Triangle that you enjoy... but it's where you are, friend; don't be afraid to wonder.
